    <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>
    An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line. 
    
    For example, 
    
    <ul>
        <li>y = 8x - 2</li>
        <li>ax<sub>1</sub> + bx<sub>2</sub> - cx<sub>3</sub> = 9</li>
    </ul>

    are some of the examples of a linear equation in two and three variables. 
    
    Slope of intersection of two linear equations: Linear equations 
    <p>y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>1</sub> + a and</p>
    <p>y2 = mx<sub>2</sub> + b</p>

    for the points <b>P</b>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and <b>Q</b>(<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) is :
    <p>
        <b>m = (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)</b>
    </p>
